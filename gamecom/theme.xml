			<text>The Game.com is a handheld game console released by Tiger Electronics in September 1997. It featured many new ideas for handheld consoles and was aimed at an older target audience, having PDA-style features and functions such as a touchscreen and stylus.  The first game.com included two slots for game cartridges and could be connected to a 14.4 kbit/s modem, making it the first handheld to include Internet connectivity.  By the end of it's life, under 300,000 Game.coms were sold.</text>
