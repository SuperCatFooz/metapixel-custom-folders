			<text>Released in 1991 in North America and 1992 in Europe, the Philips CD-i (short for Compact Disc Interactive) is an interactive multimedia CD player that doubles as a fourth-generation video game system. It was created to provide more functionality than an audio CD player or game console, but at a lower price than a personal computer with a CD-ROM drive at the time.  The CD-i was a commercial failure, selling one million units across all manufacturers in seven years, and losing Philips $1 billion.</text>
